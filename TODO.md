# To Do

* Instead of subtracting time from start time, create new variable and sum both
* start/stop
* Count down
* Allow more input times
* Make it unable to set alarm to less than the elapsed time is
* Execute a command alarm is ringing
* Try using some colors the improve experience

# Bugs

* Resetting when paused starts at 23:59:59 but should start at 00:00:00
